## Description

This application successfully generates a 3 character logo using node libraries through the terminal command line. The libraries that were used included: inquirer, file system, and jest. The inquirer library was used to prompt the user questions regarding their desired logo. The file system library was used to write the user input into a file that generates the logo. The jest library was used to test the functionality of our code. I also downloaded the SVG extension for VScode to generate the SVG logos, and to preview them directly from VS code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/sandyvzqz/module10challenge.git
   
2. Download the SVG logo maker extension by clicking [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg).

3. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

4. Install node.js using the terminal.

5. Run the command 'npm init -y' to initialize a package.json file to store project files.

6. Run the command 'npm i' to install all required libraries for the application.

7. Type the command 'node index.js' into the terminal to run the application. 

## Usage

To start the application, open the terminal and run 'node index.js'. The terminal will take you through 4 prompt questions, which must be answered to generate your new logo. Once the prompt questions have been answered, the 'logo.svg' file will be updated containing the data from user prompt questions. To see your logo, simply right click the 'logo.svg' file and choose 'Preview SVG', this will open your logo to the side.
To test the code functionality, navigate to the 'shapes.test.js' file and run 'npm run test' in the terminal. The jest library will test the code and pass all tests.
Here is a link to a short demonstration video that shows how the application works. [Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-EiOZPrJxmw5sAOf84CCADj0iccXGbah/view?usp=drive_link)
